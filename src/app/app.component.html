        <p>I am a developer with four years of professional experience.
           I love learning new technologies and would say my biggest
          strength is the speed at which figure things out. My strategy when 
          coding is to write code quickly then go back and extensivly
          test and refine. I am cofomfortable working alone or
          with a team/partner.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <div style="float:left;width:50%">
        <p>I was born and raised in rural Eastern Oregon.
           My early life was mostly in a farm type setting. My grandmothers' house
          where I often stayed was next to a watermelon field
          that I frequently played in. At home I grew up with all kinds
          of animals that I helped raise and take care of;
           my favorite being dogs. I currently have a French bulldog named
          Nelson.
        </p>
        <p>

          As I grew up I quickly found a love for technolgy and 
          computers that I have kept to this day. I enjoy problem solving as
          well as analyzing and categorizing data.
           All of these things led me to learn about programming which eventaully
          followed to this career path.
        </p>
